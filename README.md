# TOT (Table Of To-Dos)
This plugin allows you to generate the table of contents related to a specific note, where each item has a checkbox.  
Especially useful for students, as it helps keep track of topics and distinguish those learned from those not yet learned.  

**Note**: Only headings up to level 4 are included in the TOT generation (by default), higher levels are currently ignored.  
This option can be tweaked in the settings.
